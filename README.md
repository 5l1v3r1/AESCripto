## Improvements

Things to do to improve the project?
- GUI (Files with large path are not fully displayed in the program)
- Perforamnce (progressbar not 100% optimized)
- Implement a file check to prevent user to add the same file twice when using the folder select option, when this happens the program will crash when try to encrypt a file thas already was previoulsy encripted in the job
- Implement safety measures to prevent user to lose data after type the wrong password when decrypting with the remove original file flagged
